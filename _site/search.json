Through an inquiry activity and using math manipulatives, students will learn more about how diagonals can be used to classify the different types of quadrilaterals. This lesson represents my teaching approach of developing a deeper mathematical understanding through inquiry based activities, and the use student focused learning."

    "text": "I designed this lesson during my placement in a high school geometry classroom. During the lesson students complete stations about transformations, including reflections, translations, and identifying symmetry. I specifically designed an activity using nearpod that helps students understand lines of symmetry while folding an origami flower. The origami flower serves as a concrete manipulative to help students learn how shapes “fold” over lines of symmetry. This lesson reflects my teaching approach of developing a deeper mathematical understanding through inquiry based activities, and the use student focused learning."

I place a high priority on getting to know students, from learning their names by the third day to attending their sports games and activities. Relationships are truly what do the work of classroom management.\nMistakes make learning happen\n\nFor real learning to happen, both in content and socioemotional skills, students will need to feel comfortable making mistakes. From the content perspective, I want students to share their answers and take risks, even if they are wrong. When it comes to behavior and expectations, every student gets a fresh start every day, no matter what happened yesterday. Students are still learning how to exist in our society, and need to be given grace when they make mistakes.\n\nClassrooms should represent the community\nAs a white, female teacher, I represent the majority of the teaching workforce. I want to teach in diverse schools, where the majority of students do not look like me. With the aid of students, caregivers, and community members, I will iterate on and shape my classroom management system so that it reflects the values of the community. Students will feel more comfortable taking risks academically if they feel comfortable in the classroom."

    "text": "My teaching philosophy consists of five key pillars detailed below:\n\nStudents need to engage in inquiry driven instruction to develop a deep conceptual understanding of math. By engaging in productive struggle, students develop number sense, and a better understanding of math than the rote memorization of procedures.\nTeaching socioemotional skills is core to deepening students’ understanding of math. Without self awareness, management, and relationship skills, students are not prepared to productively struggle with math.\nDiverse perspectives and experiences are a strength in the classroom. Students should see everyone as doers of mathematics, regardless of race, culture or linguistic background.\nOur ultimate goal as teachers is to give students transferable skills so they can learn anything they want to. Teaching students skills such as meta cognition enable students to chart a path into life long learning.\nRelationships are the center of everything we do as teachers. I became a teacher because I want to build relationships as a career. Students need adults in their lives who trust them, believe in them, and want them to succeed."
