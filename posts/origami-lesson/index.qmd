I designed this lesson during my placement in a high school geometry classroom. During the lesson students complete stations about transformations, including reflections, translations, and identifying symmetry. I specifically designed an activity using nearpod that helps students understand lines of symmetry while folding an origami flower. The origami flower serves as a concrete manipulative to help students learn how shapes "fold" over lines of symmetry. This lesson reflects my teaching approach of developing a deeper mathematical understanding through inquiry based activities, and the use student focused learning.
