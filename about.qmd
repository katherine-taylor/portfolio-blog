I'm currently getting my master's degree in mathematics education at the University of Virginia (UVA), and I'd love to teach at a middle school in a diverse community following graduation. I also got my undergraduate degree from UVA in 2020 in Systems Engineering and Statistics, where I also served as drum major of the marching band for two years. In my spare time, I love to play bassoon, read, watch Formula One, and cheer on the Hoos. My resume is linked below:
